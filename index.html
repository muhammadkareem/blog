      <h2>
INTRODUCTION:</h2>
      <p><b>IF we take a look in the previous time of about four to five years back at that time developers had to give their lots of time and energy in just thinking about the servers: how to buy them, how to power, and how to keep them cool and dry, especially about upgrading them and many more .But today, while living in this modern age, the concept of a server based app is giving a new route to the more distributed �microservices� model.
As Ken Fromm wrote on ReadWrite as far back as 2012,</b></p>
      <p> <b>�It�s no longer about building a �Web app.� It�s about building a distributed system of loosely coupled components in the cloud.�</b></p>
      <p><b>Rather than developing a complete, all through apps, and storing them on server as a single stuff, developers are uploading code that are trigger  in response to events, such as  uploading a document, tapping a �buy� button, or submitting a form.
As Janakiram MSV recently wrote in Forbes,</b></p>
      <p><b>    �Serverless computing and microservices are ushering a new form of web-scales computing.�</b></p><img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9w21k7PE0-Q/V2Jd7rfUSmI/AAAAAAAAAK0/nsZZI57ZjpUfVX_ANAAG_H1aLJIvBawdwCLcB/s1600/shutterstock_229442263.jpg"
      />
      <h3>As the demand for microservices grows, the big names in cloud computing are beginning to catch on.</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Amazon launched AWS Lambda that charges for the total number of requests across all the app�s functions</li>
        <li>Google quietly launched its own serverless computing solution, Google Cloud Functions Alpha earlier this year</li>
        <li>Microsoft is reportedly working on a new service for the Azure platform.</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>AWS LAMBDA FUNCTION:</h2>
    <ul class="blog">
      <p><b>AWS Lambda is serverless compute service thar run your code in response to events and automatically manages the essential compute possessions for you. You caan use AWS Lambda to spread other AWS services that operates at AWS scale, it's performance and security. AWS Lambda can automatically run code in response to numerous events, such as adaptations to objects in Amazon S3 buckets or tabel updates in Amazon Dynamo DB.
After you upload your code to AWS Lambda, you can also links your function by means of specific AWS resources (e.g: a particular Amazon S3 buckets, Amazon Dynamo DB table, Amazon Kinesis stream or Amazon SNS notification). Then when if the resources changes, Lambda will accomplish your function and be able to the compute resources as desired in order to keep up with arriving requests.

    <h2>TRADITIONAL WEB APPLICATIONS ARCHITECTURE:</h2>
    <p><b>The traditional web application architecture includes two things the client and the server client issues the request and server response to that request and sends back data. This is the traditional way of setting web.While using this you can develop a great app and share this to your friends and it goes viral, may be today you have few users but tomorrow you have many of them.</b></p>
    <h3>What do you need to do?</h3>
    <p><b>      <p><b>The traditional web application architecture includes two things the client and the server client issues the request and server response to that request and sends back data.

    <h3>What do you need to do?</h3>
    <p><b>Basically you need to scale your server side and there are different approaches to that,</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Just take a look at you and current service provider</li>
      <li>Booked the next year so which might be little bit bigger for you and web application can handle the traffic</li>
    </ul>
  </aside>
  <article>
    <p><b>Another thing which you might also consider is to add some kind of load balance and multiple servers and load balance side to side which server should handle the traffic so you can scale independently you can add more servers and everything is fine but as you may already have seen you really have to administrate everything and if the server fails or if the load balance fails or whatever everything fails.</b></p><img
      src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-UP1L-HWM0GE/V2JgyBJzBbI/AAAAAAAAALM/ODD7bA-k9pIGBkBCVDCY7rXUJC7HVtxLQCLcB/s1600/tradition%2Barchitecture2.png" />
    <p><b>Additionally, you need to keep your server up to date so you need to be aware of security updates and really to manage everything so that hackers won�t break your application that�s another thing you should be aware of if you�re developing such an application.</b></p>
    <h3>PAYING POINTS:</h3>
    <p><b>Additionally it may be little bit costly so you may be have to pay 3 or 5 service even if they are either and no body uses the application anymore.</b></p>
    <h3>
SERVERLESS APPLICATION ARCHITECTURE:</h3>
    <p><b>In Serverless Architecture a great thing would be that you simply just write your code deployed on a kind of black box and everything runs smoothly and you do not have to manage everything by hand or have to care about it well, this seems to be like a dream but it�s already a reality right now.
Different cloud providers such as Amazon AWS have introduced so called function as a service Modder�s where you just have to provision your code you upload your code and they care of everything else.</b></p>
    <h3>For example:</h3>
    <p><b>your request comes in, then they will spin out in your container run your so called lambda function which is simply to code your wrote and after that the container will get idol again. So,</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>if you have one request you can simply handle this with one container</li>
    </ul>
  </article>
  <article><img src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-sMH3E-NgFuI/V2JzRE67-1I/AAAAAAAAALc/H61OQBLrT7gR-_pvz-zZ-zNPkrod4Gy6ACLcB/s1600/serverless-architecture.png" />
    <p><b>similarly, and if you have three requests no problem three containers will spin out any application which runs smoothly</b></p>
  </article>
  <article><img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JEKX2ggg9TQ/V2J0EI82dRI/AAAAAAAAAL4/q1BJrGuZ4Bkd9LRBXYlLzQLm3gN8FlB9wCKgB/s1600/severless%2Barchitecture3.png" />
    <p><b>similarly, if you have one thousand or  million requests no problem they were just been the containers out run your code and they go back to viral you can handle and infinitely amount of requests.</b></p>
  </article>
  <article><img src="" https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5RDHZsX6LR8/V2J0lK5J7rI/AAAAAAAAALw/kb0CFMtjFnYwF6mLcnhGPzBAakyFZEFZwCLcB/s1600/serverless-architecture2.png/>
    <p><b>The infrastructure providers such as Amazon the cloud provider will take care of everything for you and even if your application is not using anymore you will not have to pay anything because the containers are in the idol mode and you only have to pay for the compute time they were used to run so that�s the really great model.</b></p>
    <p><b> That�s basically the server less architecture so you really don�t have to think about service you just apply a code and cloud provider will take care of everything else they update the security patches on containers they will take care of container management and they will take care of everything so that your code runs smoothly.</b></p>
    <h3>PRACTICAL EXAMPLE:</h3>
    <p><b>Suppose a is large application with about 16,000 request a day about two hundred milliseconds average response time and they have deployed application on EC2 and they paid about $3 a day to keep everything up and after that they change the deployment and deployed code in server less architecture so they use the lambda functions which are provided by AWS and they only pay 5 cents a day so as you see this is really really cheap that�s due to the cost that the lambda and the architecture the cloud provider will only charge for the amount of time to code to run so if your code is not used you won�t have to pay anything.</b></p>

    <h2>Google, Microsoft, Apple and Mozilla Working Together On WebAssembly For Faster Web:</h2>
    <p><b>The genius minds at Google, Microsoft, Mozilla and Apple are coming together to create WebAssembly (also known as wasm). This is a new binary format � bytecode � to be used in browsers in future and promises about 20 times faster performance. Bytecode is a machine-readable instruction set that is faster for web browser to load as compared to high-level programming languages.</b></p>
